## Dataset Overview

The dataset (`shopify.xlsx`) contains information scraped from the Shopify App Store. The data includes:

1. **Apps**: Details about Shopify apps.
2. **Apps Categories**: Mapping apps to their respective categories.
3. **Categories**: Information about app categories.
4. **Reviews**: User reviews for apps, including ratings, comments, and developer responses.

## Analysis Process

### **Part 1: App Landscape**

#### Objective:
Understand the distribution and statistics of Shopify apps.

1. **KPI Card: Unique Number of Apps**  
   - A KPI card was created to display the total unique number of apps in the dataset.  
   - **Result:** A count of **7,341 unique apps** was determined.  
   - **Screenshot:** Refer to `Screenshot 1-KPI CARD.png` in the folder.

2. **Line Chart: Review Count Over Time**  
   - The sum of `reviews_count` was plotted over the `lastmod` date.  
   - **Result:** The chart shows fluctuating review activity over time, indicating key trends in app usage or activity.  
   - **Screenshot:** Refer to `Screenshot 2-Line Chart_Review Count Over Time.png` in the folder.

3. **Scatterplot: Reviews Count vs. Average Rating**  
   - A scatterplot visualizing `reviews_count` against `average_rating` was created.  
   - **Insights:** Apps with more reviews tend to have slightly lower ratings, suggesting a broader spectrum of opinions from users.  
   - **Screenshot:** Refer to `Screenshot 3-Scatterplot_Reviews Count vs. Average Rating.png` in the folder.

### **Part 2: Reviews**

#### Objective:
Analyze reviews and evaluate factors like helpfulness and developer responses.

1. **Helpful Reviews Calculation**  
   - A calculated column, `helpful_reviews`, was added using the formula: `rating * (1 + helpful_count)`.  
   - **Result:** The average of `helpful_reviews` is **5.48**.  
   - **Screenshot:** Refer to `Screenshot 4-Helpful Reviews.png` in the folder.

2. **Developer Answered Column**  
   - A column named `developer_answered` was added to indicate whether developers replied to reviews.  
   - **Scatterplot Insight:** Apps with developer responses tend to have slightly higher ratings on average.  
   - **Screenshot:** Refer to `Screenshot 5-Developer Answered.png` in the folder.

### **Part 3: App Reviews**

#### Objective:
Evaluate app developers' performance and responsiveness using combined app and review data.

1. **Relationship Between Tables**  
   - A many-to-one relationship was established between the `reviews` table and the `apps` table using `app_id` and `id`.  
   - **Screenshot:** Refer to `Screenshot 6-Relationship Between Tables.png` in the folder.

2. **Bar Chart: Developer vs. Sum of Rating**  
   - A bar chart was created to show the sum of ratings per developer.  
   - **Result:** Developers with more apps tend to have higher cumulative ratings.  
   - **Screenshot:** Refer to `Screenshot 7-Developer vs. Sum of Rating.png` in the folder.

3. **Bar Chart: Developer vs. Average Helpful Reviews**  
   - A bar chart showing developers against the average `helpful_reviews`.  
   - **Insight:** Developers with higher engagement produce more helpful reviews.  
   - **Screenshot:** Refer to `Screenshot 8-Developer vs. Average Helpful Reviews.png` in the folder.

4. **Bar Chart: Developer Responsiveness**  
   - A bar chart was created to display `developer_answered` values filtered by apps with more than 500 reviews.  
   - **Result:** The most responsive developers engage more with reviews, likely leading to better user satisfaction.  
   - **Screenshot:** Refer to `Screenshot 9-Developer Responsiveness.png` in the folder.
